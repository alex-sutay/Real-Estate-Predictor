# Real-Estate-Predictor
My first machine learning project.\
This project works by using the snag_prices.py file 
to splice an html file of a reality site and save the houses to the file realestate.txt.
After the training data is collected, realestate_learn.ipynb is used to run basic linear
regression on the data and create a solution for predicting prices of realestate.\
Currently, snag_prices.py is configured to work with the html from www.realtor.com
and the data is the price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage.
The data already pulled is from houses in the Rochester, NY area.
